Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for images of poodles versus images of fried chickens. Feature sets we have tried: SIFT, SIFT+Color, SURF, SURF+Color, CNN; classifier sets we have tried: Gradient Boosting Model, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine. Finally, we select best model and improved the classification accuracy for images of chickens and dogs to 80%.
